Tribological coatings are critical for reducing energy loss in mechanical systems.
This proposal addresses the challenge of developing high-temperature self-lubricating
coatings for aerospace applications. We will develop TiAlN/MoS₂ composite coatings
using reactive magnetron sputtering, optimizing composition and structure for stable
lubrication at temperatures up to 600°C. Expected outcomes include new coating
formulations with demonstrated COF < 0.15 at 500°C and wear rate < 10^-6 mm³/Nm.
This research will advance coating technology for next-generation aerospace systems.

## 3.1 Background

Tribology, the science of friction, wear, and lubrication, plays a critical role
in energy efficiency and component longevity [1]. Mechanical systems lose significant
energy to friction, with estimates suggesting 23% of global energy consumption is
attributable to tribological losses [2]. This challenge is particularly acute
in high-temperature applications where traditional liquid lubricants fail.
