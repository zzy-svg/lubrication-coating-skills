## 1. Introduction | 引言

### 1.1 Background and Significance | 背景与意义

Tribology, the science of friction, wear, and lubrication, plays a critical role in energy efficiency and component longevity in mechanical systems. Global energy consumption attributable to friction and wear losses remains significant, estimated at approximately 23% of total energy use in industrialized nations. This challenge is particularly acute in high-temperature applications where traditional liquid lubricants fail to provide adequate protection, creating an urgent need for advanced solid lubricating solutions.
